## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Permanent Action**: Deleting a webhook is permanent and cannot be undone. You will stop receiving all events that were configured for this webhook.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Immediate Effect**: The deletion takes effect immediately. No new events will be sent to the webhook URL after deletion.
</Info>

## What Happens When You Delete

1. **Event Delivery Stops**: The webhook will immediately stop receiving events
2. **Pending Deliveries**: Any pending retry attempts will be cancelled
3. **Statistics Preserved**: Historical delivery statistics are retained for analytics
4. **URL Released**: The webhook URL is no longer associated with your account

## Before Deleting

Consider these alternatives before permanently deleting a webhook:

### Disable Instead of Delete

If you want to temporarily stop receiving events, consider disabling the webhook instead:

```typescript
// Disable webhook instead of deleting
await inbound.webhooks.update('webhook_abc123', {
  active: false
});
```

### Update Event Subscriptions

If you only want to stop certain events, update the webhook's event subscriptions:

```typescript
// Remove specific events instead of deleting
await inbound.webhooks.update('webhook_abc123', {
  events: ['email.received'] // Remove 'email.bounced'
});
```

## Error Responses

<ResponseField name="error" type="string">
  Error message describing what went wrong
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="code" type="string">
  Error code for programmatic handling
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Webhook Not Found
{
  "error": "Webhook not found",
  "code": "WEBHOOK_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

```json Unauthorized
{
  "error": "You don't have permission to delete this webhook",
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}
```

```json Already Deleted
{
  "error": "Webhook has already been deleted",
  "code": "WEBHOOK_ALREADY_DELETED"
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Best Practices

1. **Backup Configuration**: Save webhook configuration before deletion if you might need to recreate it
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure your webhook endpoint can handle the sudden stop of events
3. **Monitor Dependencies**: Check if other systems depend on this webhook before deletion
4. **Use Disable First**: Consider disabling the webhook temporarily before permanent deletion

## Recovery

If you accidentally delete a webhook, you'll need to recreate it using the [Create Webhook endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/create-webhook). Make sure to:

- Use the same URL and event subscriptions
- Update any systems that reference the old webhook ID
- Reconfigure any retry settings or descriptions
