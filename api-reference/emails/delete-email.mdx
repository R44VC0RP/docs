## Alternative: Disable Instead of Delete

If you want to temporarily stop receiving emails without permanently deleting the address, consider updating the email status to `inactive` using the [Update Email endpoint](/api-reference/emails/update-email) instead.

```typescript
// Disable instead of delete
await inbound.emails.update('email_abc123', {
  status: 'inactive'
});
```

This allows you to re-enable the email address later without losing the configuration.
